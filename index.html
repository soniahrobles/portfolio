        <h1>Jeff Koones Inspired Collage</h1>
        <p>
            This piece is heavily inspired by Jeff Koons’ influence in its bold layering of everyday symbols, turning the ordinary into a spectacle of wonder and artificial beauty. Bright lips, wild animals, flowers, and architectural fragments blended in an imagined landscape that is both playful and uncanny.

        <h1>UCSB Collage</h1>
        <p>
            The piece is a vibrant, modern collage celebrating the unique spirit of UCSB pictured as a university by the waves. Layering coastal imagery with symbols of student life, campus landmarks, team pride, and bursts of color. It’s a tribute to school spirit, academic culture, and the feeling of possibility an acceptance letter represents.

        <h1>Fresas Collage</h1>
        <p>
            This piece reflects girlhood as an era shaped by beauty products, trends, and shared rituals. By layering makeup packaging and familiar brands, it captures the collective passage through experimentation, belonging, and the aesthetics that define a stage of growing up. The strawberries reference the Mexican slang ‘fresa,’ which translates to strawberry and is used to describe a girly girl.

        <h1>Layered Realities</h1>
        <p>
            Layered Realities explores the interconnected systems of nature, humanity, and machine through a light-reactive, three-layered painting. Each layer(cyan, magenta, and yellow) reveals 
            itself under red, green, or blue LED light, allowing different narratives to emerge depending on the illumination. The work is framed by 3D-printed vines and flowers, with laser-cut 
            mechanical elements embedded into the painting itself, blending organic and industrial materials.  This fusion of handcraft and digital fabrication reflects our shifting relationship 
            with media technologies. Responding to the course’s theme of perception and mediated experience, the piece uses light as a metaphor for how technology filters reality. AI tools and 
            digital design processes shaped the structure and visual logic of the work, making the act of "revealing" both visual and conceptual.

        <h1>Laser Cut Hands</h1>
        <p>
            I designed and laser cut the hands as a modern take on woodworking, a craft practiced for centuries through direct, hands-on making. The piece highlights how traditional art forms can evolve through digital fabrication and technologies while preserving its essence.

        <h1>Playing Cards Wooden Box</h1>
        <p>
            This card box was sketched out, modeled in Fusion, and laser cut using press-fit locks for assembly. The hand-designed sun symbol on the lid functions as a viewing window, letting the user glimpse the card inside while also serving as a unique decorative element. Balancing practicality and design, the box securely stores a deck while highlighting the creative process from concept to finished piece.
