        <h1>Layered Realities</h1>
        <p>
            Composed as a post-digital palimpsest, this chromatic field mobilizes glitch as method. Pixel-fragments
            aggregate into a rhizomatic cartography whose center blooms in sunset hues, then withdraws into zones of
            opacity. The work interrogates screen vernaculars—compression artifacts, latency, jitter—while staging their
            materiality as painterly event. Affective bandwidth oscillates between legibility and noise, producing a
            contingent image that is at once indexical and unstable. Architecture appears and unbuilds itself;
            landscapes surface as data residues. Through recursive layering and ruptures, the composition enacts an
            ethics of attention, asking the viewer to inhabit thresholds where mediation becomes subject, and perception
            rehearses its own estrangement.

        <h1>Obscure Resistance</h1>
        <p>
            This photograph stages an entropic field of standardized matter: a rhizomatic lattice of through-hole
            resistors suspended in a translucent armature. The work mobilizes the color-band taxonomy as a chromatic
            code—teal, ochre, carbon black—oscillating between legibility and noise. Refusing a single point of focus,
            the composition produces a non-hierarchical spatialization where vectors, tolerances, and failure thresholds
            cohabit. The image operates as an index of analog labor, a salvage archive of pre-digital desire, while its
            metallic glare invokes the haptic promise of circuitry never completed. By compressing utility into
            ornament, the piece performs an ethics of resistance: a poetics of signal damped into aesthetics. What
            emerges is less still life than infrastructural sublime—an ambient diagram of how objects conspire to slow
            the world down.

        <h1>Layered Realities</h1>
        <p>
            Layered Realities explores the interconnected systems of nature, humanity, and machine through a light-reactive, three-layered painting. Each layer(cyan, magenta, and yellow) reveals 
            itself under red, green, or blue LED light, allowing different narratives to emerge depending on the illumination. The work is framed by 3D-printed vines and flowers, with laser-cut 
            mechanical elements embedded into the painting itself, blending organic and industrial materials.  This fusion of handcraft and digital fabrication reflects our shifting relationship 
            with media technologies. Responding to the course’s theme of perception and mediated experience, the piece uses light as a metaphor for how technology filters reality. AI tools and 
            digital design processes shaped the structure and visual logic of the work, making the act of "revealing" both visual and conceptual.

        <h1>Radio Interference</h1>
        <p>
            A cacophony of static, a symphony of noise. This audio piece is a collage of radio interference, capturing
            the ephemeral beauty of disrupted signals. It's like eavesdropping on the universe's forgotten
            conversations, where each crackle and hiss tells a story of lost frequencies. The soundscape oscillates
            between chaos and clarity, inviting listeners to find meaning in the dissonance. It's an auditory
            exploration of how technology mediates our experience, revealing the hidden poetry in disruption. Tune in,
            turn up the volume, and let the interference wash over you.
